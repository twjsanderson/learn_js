/**
 * So what is JavaScript and why should I learn it?
 * 
 * This is a great question. JavaScript is a hugely popular programming language that is used all over the world. 
 * It was originally built by a man named Brendon Eich for a company called Netscape back in 1995.
 * 
 * It was intended to run inside a web browser and give websites dynamic behaviour in contrast to static websites of the early 90's.
 * 
 * Some examples of the dynamic behaviour JavaScript allows for are:
 * 
 * - Loading new web page content without reloading the page
 * - Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out
 * - Playing games in the browsers
 * 
 * Early on JavaScript was only designed to run inside browsers (that piece of software was the only thing that could run JavaScript). In contrast various other languages 
 * like C++, C, Java (which has nothing to do with JavaScript) were used to build software that could run inside an operating system like Windows or Linux. 
 * At the time there were no environments in operating systems that could really execute JavaScript outside the browser. 
 * 
 * This meant that we could only run JavaScript when someone called a server (ie. entered a URL address) and was sent a bunch of HTML/CSS & JavaScript files
 * that would be loaded into and then run in your browser.
 * 
 * In 2009 a guy called Ryan Dahl created a runtime environment that would allow developers to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser. 
 * This opened up a world of new possibilities for developers to start using JavaScript as a backend language the could be used to build
 * servers and even interact with the operating system.
 * 
 * As of 2022 and the creation of this video, JavaScript is now a well supported langauge with thousands of libraries, framework ands applications
 * to choose from. You can do everything from building instance chat apps, building Machine Learning models, building apps on various blockchains 
 * and even doing 3D rendering.
 * 
 * In the next video I will walk you through setting up Node.js on your own computer and in various environments so you can start running JavaScript
 * code your self.
