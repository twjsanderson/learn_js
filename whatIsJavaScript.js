/**
 * So what is JavaScript and why should I learn it?
 * 
 * This is a great question. JavaScript is a hugely popular programming language that is used all over the world. 
 * It was originally built by a man named Brendon Eich for a company called Netscape back in 1995.
 * 
 * It was intended to run inside a web browser and give websites dynamic behaviour in contrast to static websites of the early 90's.
 * 
 * Some examples of the dynamic behaviour JavaScript produces are:
 * 
 * - Loading new web page content without reloading the page
 * - Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out
 * - Playing games in the browsers
 * - Authenticating users with a backend server
